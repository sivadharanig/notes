                                    Angular basics document

angular is  the one of the powerful framework to build a froent end framework

we can  use  .HTTP

    file to create  the froent ennt

we can use .CSS
    
    file  to create the style to html.

we can use .ts 

    file to create the write the besniss logics to frent end 
   get,put,post,etc.


THERE ARE THE STRUCTURE OF ANGULAR IS

 *.HTML
 *.CSS
 *SPEC.TS
 *.TS

 TO CREATE THE ANGULAR project 

 first you want to install 

ANGULAR

  npm install -global @angular/cli

THEN CREATE PROJECT
  
  ng new ______ ->project name

Then 

  in side the project go to src->app folder

 and create COMPONEND there

 ng generate component ____-> component name 
 
 ng g c ___

AND to run the code 
 
 ng serve

 ng s
 
 ng s --open

 the index.html is  main frame of the frent view is using in testing
 Style.css is the main file to hit the give styel to the full fiele


 the main .ts is using

        is  the  main file if u run this code it will run the project
        it goes to ser->app-AppModule and it goes to  src-> environmnt -env.ts
        hit and run the proggram

        import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
        import { environment } from './environments/environment';

environements
        
        is   use to link you project url to  specifi to all component 

   in case if you want to change the url chang her is easy to replace evry componet

      !!! OTHER WISE YOU DARECTELY LINK YOU URL IN TO THE COMPONET YOU WANT TO REPLACE  EACH AND EVERY COMPONENT IS COMPLICATED !!!

ASSETS
  
  src->assets

 this file is holding ther ervery image AND ALL MEDIA  file of  over projects.

       Angular is a framework for building client applications in HTML and either JavaScript or a language like TypeScript that compiles to JavaScript.

  The framework consists of several libraries, some of them core and some optional.
 
Modules
Components
Templates
Metadata
Data binding
Directives
Services
Dependency injection


MODELES
-------
     Angular apps are modular and Angular has its own modularity system called Angular modules or NgModules.
 
 
Every Angular app has at least one Angular module class, the root module,
conventionally named AppModule.


      || src/app/app.module.ts  ||


import { NgModule }      from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
@NgModule({
  imports:      [ BrowserModule ], --> we want to declare what are the componennt are imported
  providers:    [ Logger ],
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],--> we want to declre the created componet name 
  exports:      [ AppComponent ],
  bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ],
  enteryComponent[pop ]--> is useing to popup wondow eg(error,account creatddd)

})
export class AppModule { }
